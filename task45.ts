// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
// The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name.
// It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with
//  the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional
// feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s
//  returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
